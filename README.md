## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript vanilla (DOM manipulation, event handlers)

## Validation Logic

- Fields checked on submit
- Validation includes not only empty fields but regex and built-in functions.
- Error messages are displayed under each field.
- Message input has to be at least 20 characters.

## Accessibility 
- Keyboard support (ESC closes popup)
- Clear focus states for form fields
- Good background colors/textcolors for visibility.
- Font-size big for visibility.
- Error messages in red color for visibility.

## Future improvements 
- Server-side validation and submission
- Backend integration
- Improved accessibility (test on multiple browsers and different screens.
- Unit- and pen-testing with server side.
